    In React, useState is a built-in Hook that allows functional components to maintain and update their own internal data (state).

Before Hooks, functional components were "stateless"—they could only receive data via props and couldn't "remember" anything between renders. useState changed this by giving functions the ability to preserve data across the component's lifecycle.

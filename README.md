  <p>
    In React, useState is a built-in Hook that allows functional components to maintain and update their own internal data (state).
    Before Hooks, functional components were "stateless"—they could only receive data via props and couldn't "remember" anything between renders. useState changed this by        giving functions the ability to preserve data across the component's lifecycle.

  <li>Use Reducer</li>
  <p>
    useReducer is a React Hook used for managing complex state logic. While useState is the standard for independent variables, useReducer is the preferred choice when the       next state depends on the previous one or when multiple pieces of state need to update together.
    It is based on the architectural pattern of a Reducer Function, which decouples the "how" of state updates from the "what" of user events.
